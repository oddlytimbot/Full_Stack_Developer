# full_stack_lab2_persistence

In this lab we start work on the first tier of the full-stack, the persistence layer. Working with databases!

We need to do this the smart way.

The common way to install a database (like Mongodb) would be to simply apt-get the software through the operating system and install it.....but wait! Think of your team!

When the next person tries to get up and running, will they know they need to follow all the steps to install the database before they begin coding?? We could document it in the README, but that seems like a lot of work.

We have options.

In this lab we will update our environment to use a Debian-based distro, write automation shell scripts to add a secure key, update our sources, install, configure, and create a user for MongoDB.

Now we're talking full stack development!

### Covered

* Working with SSH keys
* Writing shell scripts
* Secure installation of Mongodb

In addition, once we've got our database installed we'll get busy learning about "schema-less" data.

* Basics of Mongodb
* Modelling document-based data 
* Using the Repl
* Inserting, finding, updating and removing documents

By the completion of this lesson and assignments, any of your classmates should be able to easily clone your repo to a fresh environment, and get fully up and running with Mongo.
