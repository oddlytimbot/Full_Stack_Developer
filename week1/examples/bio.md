# Welcome Aboard

Hello friends, and welcome to Full Stack Development, your course on modern web application development.

Below you can find an example biography, written using markdown. You will be completing a similar biography, and commiting it into a code repository.

The main purpose of this exercise is to ensure that your coding environment is properly set up for completing lessons. You'll need to become acquainted with code-versioning via Git - an essential skill for any modern developer.

Lessons in this course are completed in the manner of a modern development environment, so that you can learn not only good coding skills, but proper practices for working with a group of developers.

_With this first assignment, you will learn about:_

- Creating markdown - markdown format is the most popular means for documenting projects, allowing quick formatting of text
- Installing Git - the number one tool for code versioning
- Working with the command-line

## About the Professor

My name is Tim, I’m frequently called “Timbot” in programming circles. I have a deep background in interactive development, having started in the early eighties on systems like the Commodore Vic20, Acorn, Timex-Sinclair 1000 and a variety of other computers that no longer exist. My favorite programming challenge then was re-creating my own versions of popular coin-op video games like Centipede, Pooyan, Joust and Robotron.

### Background

I got my first commercial job at an interactive creative agency called Organic, where I began on a 3-day temporary contract, but by two years was the director of Engineering. I achieved this fast-track by custom developing productivity software for our teams on my own. My engineering group did rapid-prototyping for all interface development on large automotive accounts like Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep.

Following that I started my own company, hired a team, and developed Oddly Studios into a top creative technology company that I ran for 12 years. We did everything from video games, to websites, to software, to sizable interactive installations like the PanAm Games, Calgary Stampede, and Autoshow.

Today I’m a maker-mentor at a community makerspace where I teach everything from programming, to robotics, fabrication, CAD/CAM and CNC. I am well versed in both client and server-side technologies, IT, security, hardware-hacking, and embedded systems.

_I'm a life-long learner_

Of course, there is always more to know! I consider myself a life-long learner, and have always enjoyed teaching as a means to surround myself with others who have a thirst for knowledge.

I look forward to working with each one of you!
