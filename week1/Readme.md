# full_stack_lab_1

Welcome to lab 1 of the full stack development course.

In this lab we will get our environments up and running, including getting familiar with many of the tools commonly used in creating full end-to-end software with modern technologies.

These will include:
1. The Terminal
2. Common unix commands
3. Code versioning with Git
4. Collaborative coding 
5. Documentation with Markdown
6. Use of automation software with NPM

Outcomes:
1. Creation of your first code repository
2. Initialization of your coding environment
3. Launch of your first Node server

## Lesson Description

During the course of this lab you will register, update your profile and get familiar with your new git account at oddlylabs. You will create your first repository and learn to prepare it with a .gitignore file and license.

You'll be required to add a collaborator from among your classmates, and learn about creating issues and pull requests such as would regularly be done in a production environment.

Additionally, you will get familiar with the features of a development environment. You will launch a cloud9 IDE, and learn how to add collaborators and enter into collab-coding sessions.

With code versioning, collaboration, and environment set up you'll learn the basics of working with the command line, including:

* cloning your code repository
* basics of adding/committing/pushing with Git
* how to create development branches and merge them
