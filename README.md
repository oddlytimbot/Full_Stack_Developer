# Full_Stack_Developer

Welcome to the Full Stack Developer course at Humber, brought to you by OddlyStudios.

This course will take you through all the steps of developing modern web applications. You'll start by becoming familiar with tools like Git and Docker used by full-stack developers, and finish by demonstrating a multi-tier distributed application you have build week by week.

## Critical Path

---

Week 1

### Get Up and Running

In this first lesson, we get you up and running in a modern development environment, including code versioning tool (git), virtualization (docker), and node.js. We review the most common command-line tools.

- Introductions
- Sign up at Oddlylabs
- Install/Update a git client
- Introduction to command-line
- Create first repo, create a Readme and learn Markdown and versioning

Week 2

### Containers and Virtualization

We begin work on the first tier of the stack - the persistence layer. In this lesson we will use our command-line skills to create automation scripts for installing and configuring a modern no-sql database (mongo) in a Docker container.

- Download a docker image
- Launch a container
- Use the Mongo Repl
- Learn to assign pull requests

Week 3

### API Access via Micro-Service

Tier 1 of our persistence layer takes shape now that we have a working Mongo Database installation. We introduce Node and the Express module. We also demonstrate asyncronous actions, and three different ways to handle them with Javascript.

Week 4

### Securing Access

Now that data is getting stored in the database, it is time to get familiar with the basics of authentication. We will examine the popular B-crypt module for secure password handling, and update our service.
