# Full_Stack_Developer

Week 1
Get Up and Running

In this first lesson, we get you up and running in a modern development environment, including code versioning tool (git), virtualization (docker), and node.js. We review the most common command-line tools.

Week 2
Tier 1 - Persistence

We begin work on the first tier of the stack - the persistence layer. In this lesson we will use our command-line skills to create automation scripts for installing and configuring a modern no-sql database (mongo).
